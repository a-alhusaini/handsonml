# Handsonml

This is one of my projects. The idea is to learn machine learning with Elixir. But I couldn't find any good resources to learn ML with Elixir. So I embarked on a seperate path. That path started with a single question:

"What if I learned the material whithout using an elixir resource?"

That is where this project got started. I decided to pick up a copy of Hands on machine learning with scikit-learn, keras, and tensorflow. Except I'd do all the code with elixir.

It sounded like an idea a genius would come up with... But things weren't as simple as they seemed.

The main issue I ran into is that there simply weren't any libraries that matched scikit learn in the elixir world. So I ended up having to implement a bunch of ideas on my own. Such as Stratified shuffling.

Is this a good way to learn? Yes, but it won't be easy.
